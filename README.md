# Stage 3

Use API with blog posts. Before to start `docker-compose up`, copy `data/posts.json` to `data/db.json` to let "json-server" be able to touch it. You may adapt `posts.json` and copy again the file to `db.json` afterward.

In that stage, we're using:

- httpClientModule and httpClient
- a `service` and `environment` to get api url
- ngBootstrap to have bootstrap directives

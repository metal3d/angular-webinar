# First stage

This project is generated with `ng` client with "routing" activated to be able to create routes - standard application made for mobile device can avoid to use routing :

```
ng new app --name="Smile" --routing
```

After having started docker-compose.yml, `npm` installs the requirements and then `ng start` is launched. So you may now visit http://127.0.0.1:4200
